## Acknowledgements
AIRWOLF was developed under the NOAA Cooperative Agreement Award #NA19OAR4320073 as part of the FY22 NOAA HPCC Information Technology Incubator program.

## Uses
AIRWOLF is a convolutional-neural-network-based methodology for estimating cloud-drift-motions in sequences of satellite images from the GOES-R ABI satellites.  It is trained on the [OCTANE](github.com/JasonApke/OCTANE) system, and can output both pixel displacements or navigated zonal/meridional motions.
